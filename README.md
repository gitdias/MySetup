This repository is dedicated exclusively to all the configuration files I use in my Linux setup.

On my adventures through the open‑source world I usually run Arch Linux, CachyOS, Debian, Fedora Workstation, Ubuntu Desktop, and soon some atomic distros like bluefinOS.

## Get Started 🚀

**`imback.sh`** is the bootstrap script for MySetup — a small helper that brings your preferred configuration back to a fresh system with as little friction as possible.

You can run `imback.sh` directly from the repository using either `curl` or `wget`.


**Using curl:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitdias/MySetup/main/imback.sh | bash
```

**Using wget:**
```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitdias/MySetup/main/imback.sh | bash
```
